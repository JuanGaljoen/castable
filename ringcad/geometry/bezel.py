"""bezel() — a closed-base collar (cup) that wraps the stone.

The collar wall is an outer Cylinder minus an inner Cylinder; the inner bore is
positioned to leave a solid base disk at the bottom. The base sits on the head
axis (where the shank centreline runs) so the bezel bridges shank -> seat into a
single watertight manifold — a purely open tube cannot, because its bore is
hollow exactly where the on-axis band material is. Laid onto the global +X head
axis via the shared `placement(c)`.

Deviation note: the plan sketched an open tube ("taller inner cylinder"); a
closed base is the minimal change that makes the AC3 watertight composition
satisfiable, and is the physically correct bezel (the stone rests on the base).
