"""build_solitaire() — compose shank + prong_setting + seat into one solid.

The spike fused `[_band] + _setting_solids` (peg, torus, claws) in a single
boolean batch. Splitting into shank / prong_setting (peg+claws) / seat (torus)
and fusing all three yields the same manifold (boolean union is commutative)
because every piece keeps the spike's exact placement.
